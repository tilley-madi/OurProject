##### What I Learned about Working with Remotes
Working with remote repositories like GitHub is very beneficial for a team working together on a project. \
i) It allows team members to contribute from anywhere. This could be from their home after work, or from basically anywhere in the world. \
ii) Remote repositories allow for easily tracking the history of pushes from different team members, and the contents of those pushes. This means team members are easily accountable for their contributions. \
iii) Remote repositories also provide a bit of security for the group or individual working on the project. Given that everyone is pushing relatively frequently, having the previous versions safely stored online makes it difficult to lose large amounts of progress to any accidents like a corrupted file, or a broken computer. Everything is nice and safe in GitHub's hands. \
iv) Remote repositories like GitHub also allow for a more social community centered around coding and prototyping. Exploring code from people with more experience, checking out a different point of view, or finding new ideas are always possible and beneficial. \
v)The format of GitHub also enables individuals or groups to keep their projects highly organized. Any number of different project files can be kept straight and orderly with titles, descriptions, and folders within the code section of GitHub. Especially beneficial for large scale projects with files of different coding languages and functions.
