#### WorkingLocally
##### A few notable concepts learned about the local repository are...
1)The dangers of reset, reseting moves the main branch pointer to the commit we specify but does not save the history. This means it does not keep any 
of the branches that came after it therefore is lost forever. However we also learned of another concept called revert and it accomplishes similar task of moving the 
main branch but alternitavly stores the history of ht eother branches. 
2)Another concept is the principle of HEADs. Head is a pointer tha tells git which branch to look at. This allows us to look at previous commits, if the HEAD statement does 
not point to a branch this is an indicator that the head has detached. We go into more detail about that in Part A.
3)We also learned about the concept of resotre which is a simple way to backtrack your work. It allows you to undo cha ngs made in a previous commit,
restore uncommitted stuff in your workplace and can be used with deleted files. This is a helpful topol that gives some forgiveness in your work.
